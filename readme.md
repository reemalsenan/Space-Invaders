## Problem Soving strategy

When i faced a problem in a function i follow these steps:
* Open the console in the browser and read the error.
* Go to the function that is causing the error.
* read the entire function.
* if i still can't find it, i add console.log to each part of the function to find the location of the problem.

## Technologies

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Visual Studio Code

## Future add-ons

* Let the alien shoot lazers 
* Let the alien Move left and right 
* Add a score board 
* Add different kinds of aliens and assign a different score to each of them
